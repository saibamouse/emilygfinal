				<b>Hello, my name is Emily as mentioned above!</b>
				<p><b>Student email:</b><br>S3913217@student.rmit.edu.au<br><b>Student number:</b><br>S3913217<br><b>Cultural Background:</b><br> I am Australian but my ancestors came here from England and the Netherlands.<br><b>Education:</b><br>Graduated Highschool in 2013.<br><b>Fun Facts about me:</b><br>I am a cat enthusiast, they are my favorite pets (dogs being a close second) and I happen to own 2 cats. Patch is a 5 month old kitten (black and white) and Myka is a 5 year old cat. (stripes) They were introduced to each other a month ago and Myka has learned to tolerate Patch, although she gave him some attitude the other day I was lucky enough to catch on camera!</p>

				<p>My partner owns a German Shepherd named Zeke. His father was imported from Germany and he is a fully black German Shepherd. He is just 1 year old and has the attitude of a giant mischevious baby! We take him for walks to our local botanical park throughout the week. This is a video of him getting dried after having his first professional bath.<br></p>

        <p>As for my hobbies, I have two of which I really enjoy and spend a lot of my free-time with. I play online games with my friends which include a variety of survival, team games and mmos. I actually met my partner of 2 years through Final Fantasy 14 and moved to Melbourne from Perth to live with him! I have also met a lot of my life-long friends online and by living in the eastern states now I am finally able to go to pubs and resturants with them in person. Part of my love for IT is that it allows for social networks of like-minded people to exist, play games with and communicate to each other verbally and online.
				<br>My second hobby is drawing, which I will do on my tablet from time to time. I don't have anything to display here at the moment but I may update this in the future!</p>

				<h2 class="white">My Interest in IT</h2>
				<p><b>What is your interest in IT?</b><br>My interest in IT includes a variety of reasons, for my interest in IT career wise it would have to be in either Cyber Security or Data Science as I find that these two disciplines are the most interesting to me.<br>Data Science because I am curious to learn about the changes in trends when it comes to consumer purchases and figuring out the reasons why these trends have peaked so that I can help to implement a strategy to enhance company profit margins.<br>
As for Cyber Security, my interest lies more in the Counter-Terrorism aspect. If I were to pursue a life in Cyber Security, I would want to join the ADF (Airforce) and use my abilities to help protect my country against Cyber attacks as it is estimated that there will be more Cyber warfare in the coming future with the rise of technological advances on a global scale.<br>
In a general sense I am interesting in learning so much more about computing and how our devices are able to have a life of their own with the capability of transforming our entire social construct globally by giving us unlimited access to people and information. IT has been the main drive for human development since we have dawned the 21st century and have entered the digital age so it only makes sense for me to want to learn more about it!</p>
<p><b>When did your interest in IT start?</b><br>It started when I was 15 and I was building my first computer. I had bought a Micro ATX set-up that was only used as a server by the person I had purchased it from. Since then, I had removed all the parts and placed them into a mid-tower and upgraded a lot of the older parts to suit its new capabilities. I have had an ongoing interest in IT for many years onwards and I am always excited when the latest developments in technology/computer parts are released.</p>
<p><b>Outline your experience in IT:</b><br>
My experience would include general troubleshooting with my personal and family computers, building my PC from scratch and having a basic knowledge of what the functions of hardware are and why they are important for building a working computer. However, I believe that my experience is very minimal but just enough to understand what is required of me in this course and in the IT industry in general.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
	I chose RMIT not only for its status as a Technology based University but also for its flexibility in online learning as it suits my schedule of working 30+ hours in Retail so that I am not required to be physically present for classes. My partners brother is also attending RMIT and studying Accounting. He recommended the University to me as well which has re-enforced my choice to attend this University. Before signing up I had conducting intensive research into the university and its online learning program and had concluded that this was the best university to suit my discipline and lifestyle.</p>
<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
	I expect to learn about the fundamentals of IT and explore the reasons why IT is important to our society on a global scale. I will expect to learn the history of IT and how IT has progressed to what it is today. I will be learning basic technical IT skills such as learning the basics of HTML coding to help me to advance my knowledge for coding in general. Furthermore, I hope to learn about the different career streams in IT so I have a better understanding of what I will want to become after my degree is finished.</p>

							<p><b>A description of what this position is and why it is appealing to me:</b><br>
From my understanding, this position’s main role would be monitoring of this company’s computer networks and protecting it against any security breaches that need to be dealt with accordingly. You would prepare reports and implement improvements to preventative measures against these breaches. However, there are other roles for the position including managing external relationships with government agencies, auditors, contractors, and vendors. Furthermore, you would have to assess the IT plan within the company from a cyber security perspective and actively participate in cyber security audits.<br><br>
This position seems interesting to me as it allows you to dive into the intricacies of Cyber Security within this company. I would be interested in protecting the company’s networks against Cyber Attacks as it would be extremely interesting to work against someone who is actively trying to send viruses or hack the company. It would give me valuable experience within the IT/Cyber Security industry that I can later implement into future positions if I decided to move on from this one.<br><br>
<b>Skills that would be required to obtain for this position:</b><br><br>
I would need the relevant tertiary qualifications that are specific to this industry and experience with IT infrastructure and experience in implementing cyber security frameworks. Alternatively, if I didn’t have those qualifications, I could have relevant industry experience instead. Other requirements include obtaining a baseline security clearance and having knowledge in the South Australian Cyber Security Framework (SACSF) and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). This knowledge is highly desirable according to the advertisement.<br><br><br>
<b>The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have:</b><br>
My experience is very much basic and limited as of right now. While I understand the basics of how to use and navigate Windows and have a general understanding of cloud computing, I will struggle with every other aspect of this position because I do not have the knowledge yet.<br><br>
<b>My plan to obtain these skills, qualifications and experience required for the position:</b><br>
I would prioritize gaining the qualifications first which will be my undergraduate Bachelor of Information Technology. I may study further and do a Master’s in Cyber Security to help to boost my relevancy in terms of having the right qualifications. While I committed to this study, I would commence research outside of my course specifically into the right Government frameworks and laws required for my position. In this case, it would be looking into the South Australian specific frameworks. Lastly, for my experience I would be trying to obtain a entry-level position (preferably before I finish my qualifications or just after) in the IT industry perhaps in a bank or somewhere that has a high level of sensitive information so that I can learn more about the processes in Cyber Security and what it is required to protect this type of information.</p>

				<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
				<a href="https://imgur.com/sJT8EsO"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sJT8EsO.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
				<p>Advocates are the rarest personality types of them all. They make calculated decisions to achieve their goals and can speak with great passion and conviction. Although, they can also choose to be soft-spoken and prefer to keep the peace rather than challenge others. They always strive to do the right thing and uplift the people around them to make the world a better place.<br><br>
Even though Advocates tend to be reserved, when they communicate to others they are warm and sensitive, usually making a lasting impression on people. They value authentic relationships with other people and take great care with other people’s feelings. They also need to take time to reconnect with themselves. They need to retreat to process their thoughts and feelings.<br> <br>
They tend to focus on their ideals so much that they do not take care of themselves. They burn themselves out by not allowing themselves to rest when they have work to complete. They feel that they are compelled to find a mission in their lives. When they are encountered by a problem, they want to know how to fix it. They are a good support network to right a wrong, but they must remember to take care of themselves as well as taking care of others.<br><br></p>

				<p>https://www.wizardingworld.com/outcome/slytherin</p><br>
				<p>https://pottermore.fandom.com/wiki/Slytherin</p><br>
				<p>Slytherin; a result from a personality trait based on the series Harry Potter. Slytherins are cunning, ambitious and have a tendency to look after their own. They have produced a majority of dark wizards compared to the other houses but aren't afraid to admit that. They always strive to be the best and never leave their own kind behind. Admittedly I am surprised I got this result considering if you compare it to all of my other results. Although, I am happily a proud Slytherin regardless.</p><br><br>
        <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p><br>
				<p>According to the results, it seems that I can work well in a team as I have a personality trait that usually combines well with most other personalities as I can empathize easily with other people and can co-operate accordingly. However, I must make sure to not over-whelm myself by working obsessively on a project when I can work on it in baby steps along with my future team. As for my learning style, being a visual learner means that I will have to rely on resources such as mind-mapping, graphs, charts, queue cards etc. This means I will have to encourage some visual learning tactics within my team, I may ask if we can implement a mind-map to get our ideas flowing as a group. By doing this it will help me to retain the information shared and to keep our ideas in an organized fashion that I can refer to later. Although, as an ice-breaker I will ask my fellow team mates what their learning style is, so we can implement a strategy that allows us to have the best of every world! Lastly, I would try to join a team that will get along, however, I do not always expect that they will as everyone is unique in their own way and may have colliding perspectives that could turn into clashes. In order to ensure sucess for my group I will make an effort to communicate any problems or concerns with them and give my team positive reinforcement when they make their contributions to the project or perhaps, I can help them to come up with their own strategy to improve their own workflow.</p>

					<div class="experience-content">
						<h4 class="experience-title accent">Girl2Girl - A social-media and connection service made for women!</h4>
						<p><b>Overview</b><br>
							Girl2Girl is a social media platform app for making friends. It allows women to connect to other women exclusively in an environment that makes them feel safe and secure. These connections are made through tags (on the user’s profile description) which contain a variety of hobbies that can help them to find other women that share the same mutual interests too. This app will cover more features, such as the standard video-calls, texts, gifs and emojis which will be one of the main focuses in terms of communication. Another communication method will be introduced in the form of a forum which allows for large public discussions on certain topics.</p><br><br>
               <p><b>Motivation</b><br>
							 The motivation for this app is driven by the fact that a large majority of women face sexual and/or violent harassment both online and in person. Studies show that in the US, 65% of women have experienced street harassment. However, the statistics grow in other countries such as Thailand and Brazil where the percentage of street harassment is up to 86%. In Delhi, India, infamously known as “the rape capital” about 63% have been subjected to unwanted staring, 50% were inappropriate comments, 40% have been touched/groped/grabbed and lastly 26% have been followed. (Borker 2017, p.8) Consequently, with the rise of social media becoming the new norm for social interaction this harassment has already translated to the online space making it difficult for women to feel safe anywhere. My proposition is to make an online safe-space for women to come together freely without the fear of harassment. Hopefully this app can help to reduce the amount of online harrassment and harrassment in person globally.</p><br>
