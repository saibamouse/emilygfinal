				<b>Hello, my name is Emily as mentioned above!</b>
				<p><b>Student email:</b><br>S3913217@student.rmit.edu.au<br><b>Student number:</b><br>S3913217<br><b>Cultural Background:</b><br> I am Australian but my ancestors came here from England and the Netherlands.<br><b>Education:</b><br>Graduated Highschool in 2013.<br><b>Fun Facts about me:</b><br>I am a cat enthusiast, they are my favorite pets (dogs being a close second) and I happen to own 2 cats. Patch is a 5 month old kitten (black and white) and Myka is a 5 year old cat. (stripes) They were introduced to each other a month ago and Myka has learned to tolerate Patch, although she gave him some attitude the other day I was lucky enough to catch on camera!</p>

				<p>My partner owns a German Shepherd named Zeke. His father was imported from Germany and he is a fully black German Shepherd. He is just 1 year old and has the attitude of a giant mischevious baby! We take him for walks to our local botanical park throughout the week. This is a video of him getting dried after having his first professional bath.<br></p>

        <p>As for my hobbies, I have two of which I really enjoy and spend a lot of my free-time with. I play online games with my friends which include a variety of survival, team games and mmos. I actually met my partner of 2 years through Final Fantasy 14 and moved to Melbourne from Perth to live with him! I have also met a lot of my life-long friends online and by living in the eastern states now I am finally able to go to pubs and resturants with them in person. Part of my love for IT is that it allows for social networks of like-minded people to exist, play games with and communicate to each other verbally and online.
				<br>My second hobby is drawing, which I will do on my tablet from time to time. I don't have anything to display here at the moment but I may update this in the future!</p>

				<h2 class="white">My Interest in IT</h2>
				<p><b>What is your interest in IT?</b><br>My interest in IT includes a variety of reasons, for my interest in IT career wise it would have to be in either Cyber Security or Data Science as I find that these two disciplines are the most interesting to me.<br>Data Science because I am curious to learn about the changes in trends when it comes to consumer purchases and figuring out the reasons why these trends have peaked so that I can help to implement a strategy to enhance company profit margins.<br>
As for Cyber Security, my interest lies more in the Counter-Terrorism aspect. If I were to pursue a life in Cyber Security, I would want to join the ADF (Airforce) and use my abilities to help protect my country against Cyber attacks as it is estimated that there will be more Cyber warfare in the coming future with the rise of technological advances on a global scale.<br>
In a general sense I am interesting in learning so much more about computing and how our devices are able to have a life of their own with the capability of transforming our entire social construct globally by giving us unlimited access to people and information. IT has been the main drive for human development since we have dawned the 21st century and have entered the digital age so it only makes sense for me to want to learn more about it!</p>
<p><b>When did your interest in IT start?</b><br>It started when I was 15 and I was building my first computer. I had bought a Micro ATX set-up that was only used as a server by the person I had purchased it from. Since then, I had removed all the parts and placed them into a mid-tower and upgraded a lot of the older parts to suit its new capabilities. I have had an ongoing interest in IT for many years onwards and I am always excited when the latest developments in technology/computer parts are released.</p>
<p><b>Outline your experience in IT:</b><br>
My experience would include general troubleshooting with my personal and family computers, building my PC from scratch and having a basic knowledge of what the functions of hardware are and why they are important for building a working computer. However, I believe that my experience is very minimal but just enough to understand what is required of me in this course and in the IT industry in general.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
	I chose RMIT not only for its status as a Technology based University but also for its flexibility in online learning as it suits my schedule of working 30+ hours in Retail so that I am not required to be physically present for classes. My partners brother is also attending RMIT and studying Accounting. He recommended the University to me as well which has re-enforced my choice to attend this University. Before signing up I had conducting intensive research into the university and its online learning program and had concluded that this was the best university to suit my discipline and lifestyle.</p>
<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
	I expect to learn about the fundamentals of IT and explore the reasons why IT is important to our society on a global scale. I will expect to learn the history of IT and how IT has progressed to what it is today. I will be learning basic technical IT skills such as learning the basics of HTML coding to help me to advance my knowledge for coding in general. Furthermore, I hope to learn about the different career streams in IT so I have a better understanding of what I will want to become after my degree is finished.</p>
