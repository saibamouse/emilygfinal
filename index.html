				<h2 class="white">My Interest in IT</h2>
				<p><b>What is your interest in IT?</b><br>My interest in IT includes a variety of reasons, for my interest in IT career wise it would have to be in either Cyber Security or Data Science as I find that these two disciplines are the most interesting to me.<br>Data Science because I am curious to learn about the changes in trends when it comes to consumer purchases and figuring out the reasons why these trends have peaked so that I can help to implement a strategy to enhance company profit margins.<br>
As for Cyber Security, my interest lies more in the Counter-Terrorism aspect. If I were to pursue a life in Cyber Security, I would want to join the ADF (Airforce) and use my abilities to help protect my country against Cyber attacks as it is estimated that there will be more Cyber warfare in the coming future with the rise of technological advances on a global scale.<br>
In a general sense I am interesting in learning so much more about computing and how our devices are able to have a life of their own with the capability of transforming our entire social construct globally by giving us unlimited access to people and information. IT has been the main drive for human development since we have dawned the 21st century and have entered the digital age so it only makes sense for me to want to learn more about it!</p>
<p><b>When did your interest in IT start?</b><br>It started when I was 15 and I was building my first computer. I had bought a Micro ATX set-up that was only used as a server by the person I had purchased it from. Since then, I had removed all the parts and placed them into a mid-tower and upgraded a lot of the older parts to suit its new capabilities. I have had an ongoing interest in IT for many years onwards and I am always excited when the latest developments in technology/computer parts are released.</p>
<p><b>Outline your experience in IT</b><br>
	<ul>
<li>Building computers</li>
<li>Troubleshooting</li>
<li>General use</li>
<li>Botting in games (I know its bad haha)</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
	I chose RMIT not only for its status as a Technology based University but also for its flexibility in online learning as it suits my schedule of working 30+ hours in Retail so that I am not required to be physically present for classes. My partners brother is also attending RMIT and studying Accounting. He recommended the University to me as well which has re-enforced my choice to attend this University. Before signing up I had conducting intensive research into the university and its online learning program and had concluded that this was the best university to suit my discipline and lifestyle.</p>
<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
